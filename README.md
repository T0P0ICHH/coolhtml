## what if i don't want them?
go search other repo's....

## where you get these?
i just find them in my files and that's it.

## that's cool, what is your site to check these htmls?
i don't know if i will do it but the site is `topoichh.xyz/coolhtml` in fact you need it. (site may be not done if there is not found nginx ubuntu :=) )

<p>no more faq? alr.</p>

<p>Some HTML Files may not have pictures at all, that means this is problem of local files. If you want to see the pictures upload the .html somewhere (example GitHub Pages) and you will get the result, to view with pictures we will make our site soon so yeah.</p>
